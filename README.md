This is the replication file for the paper "It’s the Homophily, Stupid! A Cross-Country Experiment on How Apolitical Similarities Affect Political Conversations in Europe", published in Political Behavior.

Notice that in order for the replication file to work, you need to adjust all file paths to you repository structures. Moreover, you always need to run the script "Analyses_pooled_data-R" before the script"Analyses_allcountries.R", because the latter makes use of the output of the former. 

If any problem arises, feel free to shoot me an email at scaduto@essb.eur.nl or to whatever email address I am currently reachable at
